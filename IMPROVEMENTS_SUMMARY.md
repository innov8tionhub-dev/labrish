# Labrish Application - Improvements Summary

## Date: October 18, 2025

This document outlines all the improvements, enhancements, and features implemented in this update.

---

## 1. Enhanced Voice Selection with Rich Metadata ✅

### What Was Implemented
- Added comprehensive voice metadata display including accent, gender, age, and description
- Increased visible voices from 8 to 12 in the selection UI
- Enhanced voice cards with better visual hierarchy and information density
- Added accent badges to quickly identify voice characteristics
- Improved voice preview player integration

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/elevenlabs-voices/index.ts` - Added extended metadata fetching
- `/src/lib/elevenlabs.ts` - Extended Voice interface with labels and metadata
- `/src/pages/TextToSpeechPage.tsx` - Enhanced UI to display voice information

### Voice Metadata Now Displayed
- **Name**: Voice identifier
- **Accent**: Geographic/cultural accent (e.g., Caribbean, British, American)
- **Gender**: Voice gender
- **Age**: Age range of voice
- **Category**: Voice category
- **Description**: Detailed voice description
- **Preview**: Audio preview with playback controls

### User Impact
Users can now make more informed decisions when selecting voices, with clear visual indicators of accent, gender, and age characteristics.

---

## 2. Blocked Voice Filtering ✅

### What Was Implemented
- Implemented server-side filtering to block specific voices
- Maurice and Monique VC voices are now completely filtered out
- Blocking happens at the API level, ensuring they never reach the client

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/elevenlabs-voices/index.ts`

### Blocked Voices
- Maurice
- Monique VC

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
const blockedVoices = ['Maurice', 'Monique VC'];
const voices = voicesData.voices
  ?.filter((voice: any) => !blockedVoices.includes(voice.name))
```

### User Impact
Users will no longer see or have access to the blocked voices in any part of the application.

---

## 3. Removed Voice Cloning and Voice Design Studios ✅

### What Was Done
- Removed Voice Cloning Studio from Quick Links
- Removed Voice Design Studio from Quick Links
- Removed unused imports (Headphones, Palette icons)
- Streamlined dashboard to show only active, functional features

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`

### Quick Links Now Show (4 total):
1. Recent Activities
2. Text-to-Speech Studio (Popular badge)
3. Advanced Analytics
4. Security Settings

### Previous Links Removed:
- Voice Cloning Studio (was showing "Coming Soon")
- Voice Design Studio (was showing "Coming Soon")

### User Impact
Cleaner, more focused dashboard without confusing "coming soon" features.

---

## 4. Global Auth Context Provider ✅

### What Was Implemented
- Created a centralized AuthContext for managing authentication state
- Provides global access to user, session, and loading state
- Handles automatic session refresh and token management
- Listens to auth state changes across the entire application

### Files Created
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `/src/App.tsx` - Wrapped app with AuthProvider
- `/src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Now uses auth context

### Auth Context API
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  session: Session | null;
  loading: boolean;
  signOut: () => Promise<void>;
  refreshSession: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Usage
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

const { user, session, loading, signOut, refreshSession } = useAuth();
```

### Benefits
- Single source of truth for authentication state
- Automatic session refresh handling
- Reduced code duplication across components
- Better performance (no redundant auth checks)
- Centralized auth event handling

### User Impact
- Smoother authentication experience
- Automatic session persistence across page refreshes
- Consistent auth behavior throughout the app
- Faster page transitions (no flash of unauthenticated content)

---

## 5. Improved Auth State Persistence ✅

### What Was Implemented
- Auth state is now maintained in React Context
- Session automatically restored on page refresh
- Persistent login state across browser sessions
- Automatic token refresh before expiration

### Technical Details
- Uses Supabase's built-in session management
- Listens to auth state changes: SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, TOKEN_REFRESHED, USER_UPDATED
- Handles session persistence via Supabase's local storage integration

### Files Modified
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Manages persistent state
- `/src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Simplified with context

### Auth Events Handled
1. **SIGNED_IN**: Updates user and session state
2. **SIGNED_OUT**: Clears user and session, redirects to login
3. **TOKEN_REFRESHED**: Updates session with new token
4. **USER_UPDATED**: Refreshes user data

### User Impact
- No need to log in after page refresh
- Seamless experience across browser tabs
- Automatic re-authentication when needed
- Better session management and security

## 6. Stripe Billing Portal Integration ✅

### What Was Implemented
- Created Stripe customer portal edge function
- Implemented real billing portal session creation
- Updated Dashboard to use actual Stripe portal instead of hardcoded URL
- Added error handling and user feedback

### Files Created
- `/supabase/functions/stripe-portal/index.ts` - Edge function for portal session creation

### Files Modified
- `/src/lib/stripe.ts` - Added `createBillingPortalSession` function
- `/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated to use real portal integration

### How It Works
1. User clicks "Manage Billing" button
2. Frontend calls `createBillingPortalSession()`
3. Edge function validates user authentication
4. Fetches Stripe customer ID from database
5. Creates Stripe billing portal session
6. Returns portal URL to frontend
7. User is redirected to Stripe's secure billing portal

### Stripe Portal Features Available
- Update payment methods
- View billing history
- Download invoices
- Manage subscription
- Cancel subscription
- Update billing information

### Requirements
- User must have an active Stripe customer ID
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable must be configured
- User must be authenticated

### Error Handling
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Handles cases where no subscription exists
- Validates authentication before proceeding
- Logs errors for debugging

### User Impact
Users can now securely manage their billing and subscription through Stripe's official customer portal, instead of a placeholder link.

## Testing Checklist

### Voice Selection
- [ ] Verify 12 voices are displayed (increased from 8)
- [ ] Check that Maurice and Monique VC are not in the list
- [ ] Verify accent badges appear on voices with accent metadata
- [ ] Confirm voice descriptions display correctly
- [ ] Test voice preview playback

### Dashboard
- [ ] Verify only 4 Quick Links are shown (not 6)
- [ ] Confirm no "Voice Cloning" or "Voice Design" links
- [ ] Test "Manage Billing" button opens real Stripe portal
- [ ] Verify proper error message if no subscription exists

### Authentication
- [ ] Log in and refresh page - should stay logged in
- [ ] Open app in new tab - should be logged in automatically
- [ ] Log out - should clear session across all tabs
- [ ] Check that protected routes still require authentication

### Stripe Billing Portal
- [ ] Click "Manage Billing" from Dashboard
- [ ] Verify redirect to Stripe customer portal
- [ ] Confirm you can view invoices and payment methods

## Environment Variables Required

All existing environment variables continue to work. Ensure the following are set:

### Required
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key (server-side)
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - ElevenLabs API key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key

### Optional
- `SITE_URL` - Base URL for return links (defaults to localhost)

---

## Database Requirements

No new database migrations required. The application uses existing tables:
- `stripe_user_subscriptions` - For Stripe customer ID lookup
- `user_generation_counts` - For usage tracking
- `user_activities` - For activity logging

Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured for all tables.
