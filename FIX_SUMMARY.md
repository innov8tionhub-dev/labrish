# Landing Page Rendering Fix

## Issue
Landing page wasn't rendering due to TypeScript compilation errors in the new `webVitals.ts` file.

## Root Cause
The `webVitals.ts` file was using browser Performance API types (`LayoutShift`, `PerformanceEventTiming`, `PerformanceNavigationTiming`) that aren't included in TypeScript's standard lib types.

## Fix Applied
Added TypeScript interface definitions for the missing Performance API types:

```typescript
interface LayoutShift extends PerformanceEntry {
  value: number;
  hadRecentInput: boolean;
}

interface PerformanceEventTiming extends PerformanceEntry {
  processingStart: number;
  processingEnd: number;
}

interface PerformanceNavigationTiming extends PerformanceEntry {
  responseStart: number;
  requestStart: number;
}
```

## File Modified
- `src/lib/webVitals.ts` - Added missing TypeScript interface definitions

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ All type definitions are now properly declared
- ✅ Dev server should render the landing page correctly

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Landing page should now render without issues.

The dev server will automatically pick up the changes and the page should load correctly now.
