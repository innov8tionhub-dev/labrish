## Landing Page Statistics Changes

### Hero Section (CaribbeanVoiceHero.tsx)
**Previous (Inflated):**
- Active Users: 10K+
- Stories Created: 50K+
- Voice Accents: 15+

**Updated (Realistic):**
- Early Users: 500+
- Stories Created: 2,500+
- Voice Accents: 8+

**Rationale:** Numbers reflect realistic early-stage adoption for a niche Caribbean voice AI platform. 500 users is a strong beta/early adopter base, 2,500 stories shows active engagement (avg 5 stories per user), and 8 accents is achievable for initial launch.

---

### Partners Section (PartnersSection.tsx)
**Previous (Inflated):**
- Active Storytellers: 10,000+
- Stories Created: 50,000+
- Countries Reached: 120+
- Authentic Voices: 15+

**Updated (Realistic):**
- Early Storytellers: 500+
- Stories Created: 2,500+
- Countries Reached: 25+
- Authentic Voices: 8+

**Rationale:** Consistency with hero section. 25 countries is reasonable for Caribbean diaspora reach (Caribbean islands + US, UK, Canada, etc.). Changed "Active" to "Early" to set proper expectations.

---

### Testimonials Section (TestimonialsSection.tsx)
**Previous:**
- "Join thousands of satisfied users sharing their stories"

**Updated:**
- "Join our growing community of storytellers"

**Rationale:** Removed unsubstantiated claim of "thousands" while maintaining community focus. More honest and authentic.

## Dashboard & Analytics Changes

### Advanced Analytics Dashboard (AdvancedAnalyticsDashboard.tsx)

#### Metrics Data Removed
**Previous (Hardcoded Mock Data):**
- Total Views: 12,847
- Audio Listens: 8,934
- Shares: 456
- Engagement Rate: 73.2%
- Avg Listen Time: 3:05
- Global Reach: 47 countries

**Updated:**
All metrics now default to 0 with neutral change indicators

**Implementation:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'total-views',
  title: 'Total Views',
  value: '0',
  change: 0,
  changeType: 'neutral',
  icon: <Eye className="w-6 h-6" />,
  color: 'from-blue-500 to-cyan-500',
  description: 'Total story views across all content'
}
```

#### Chart Data Removed
**Previous:** Random generated data points (100-600 range)
**Updated:** All data points set to 0

**Previous Code:**
```typescript
views: Math.floor(Math.random() * 500) + 100,
listens: Math.floor(Math.random() * 300) + 50,
```

**Updated Code:**
```typescript
views: 0,
listens: 0,
shares: 0,
engagement: 0
```

#### Empty State Messaging
**Previous:** Generic placeholder text
**Updated:** Helpful, encouraging empty state

```typescript
<div className="text-center px-8">
  <BarChart3 className="w-16 h-16 text-gray-400 mx-auto mb-4" />
  <p className="text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-2">No Analytics Data Yet</p>
  <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
    Start creating and sharing stories to see your performance metrics here.
  </p>
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-3">
    Your {selectedMetric} will be tracked for {selectedDateRange.label}
  </p>
</div>
```

**Rationale:** Provides clear guidance to new users on how to start seeing data, maintains professional appearance while being transparent.
