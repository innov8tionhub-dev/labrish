## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or Yarn (npm is used in this guide)
*   A Supabase project
*   An ElevenLabs API Key
*   A Stripe account with API keys

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys.

Database Setup (Supabase)
Create Supabase Project: If you don't have one, create a new project on the Supabase website.
Run Migrations: The project uses SQL migrations to set up the database schema. You can find the migration files in the supabase/migrations directory. Apply these migrations to your Supabase project.
20250623020609_fierce_paper.sql: Sets up stripe_customers, stripe_subscriptions, and stripe_orders tables, along with related enums, policies, and views.
20250623032538_broad_credit.sql: Sets up the stories table, increment_play_count function, and storage buckets for user files.
Additional tables for authentication enhancements (user_mfa_settings, security_sessions, security_events) and voice cloning (voice_clone_projects, voice_audio_samples) are also defined in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and should be created in your Supabase database.
Configure RLS: Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled by default on critical tables. Ensure the policies defined in the migration files are correctly applied.
Stripe Integration
Stripe API Keys: Ensure your STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is correctly set in your .env file.
Deploy Edge Functions: The project relies on Supabase Edge Functions for Stripe integration. Deploy the following functions from the supabase/functions directory to your Supabase project:
stripe-checkout: Handles the creation of Stripe checkout sessions.
stripe-webhook: Processes Stripe webhook events (e.g., checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded, subscription updates) to sync data with your Supabase database.
Configure Webhooks: In your Stripe Dashboard, set up a webhook endpoint pointing to your deployed stripe-webhook Edge Function URL. Configure it to listen for events like checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted, and payment_intent.succeeded.
ElevenLabs Integration
ElevenLabs API Key: Set your ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in your .env file.
Deploy Edge Functions: Deploy the following ElevenLabs-related Edge Functions from the supabase/functions directory:
elevenlabs-tts: Handles Text-to-Speech requests.
elevenlabs-voices: Fetches available voices from ElevenLabs.
batch-tts: (Optional) For processing multiple text chunks for TTS.
