## 3. Database Views

### Stripe User Subscriptions View
```sql
CREATE VIEW stripe_user_subscriptions AS
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  s.subscription_id,
  s.status as subscription_status,
  s.price_id,
  s.current_period_start,
  s.current_period_end,
  s.cancel_at_period_end,
  s.payment_method_brand,
  s.payment_method_last4
FROM stripe_customers c
LEFT JOIN stripe_subscriptions s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE c.user_id = auth.uid()
AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
AND s.deleted_at IS NULL;
```
**Purpose**: Provides authenticated users with their subscription data
**Security**: Uses `security_invoker = true` for RLS enforcement

### Stripe User Orders View
```sql
CREATE VIEW stripe_user_orders AS
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  o.id as order_id,
  o.checkout_session_id,
  o.payment_intent_id,
  o.amount_subtotal,
  o.amount_total,
  o.currency,
  o.payment_status,
  o.status as order_status,
  o.created_at as order_date
FROM stripe_customers c
LEFT JOIN stripe_orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.user_id = auth.uid()
AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
AND o.deleted_at IS NULL;
```
**Purpose**: Provides authenticated users with their order history
**Security**: Uses `security_invoker = true` for RLS enforcement

---

## 4. Database Functions

### 1. `log_user_activity`
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION log_user_activity(
  p_user_id uuid,
  p_activity_type activity_type,
  p_entity_type text DEFAULT NULL,
  p_entity_id uuid DEFAULT NULL,
  p_metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
) RETURNS uuid
```
**Purpose**: Centralized activity logging with proper security
**Security**: `SECURITY DEFINER` with stable `search_path`
**Usage**: Called from application code to track user actions

### 2. `get_user_generation_count`
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_generation_count(
  p_user_id uuid
) RETURNS integer
```
**Purpose**: Get current month's generation count for a user
**Performance**: Single query with proper indexing
**Usage**: Check user's monthly quota

### 3. `increment_generation_count`
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION increment_generation_count(
  p_user_id uuid
) RETURNS integer
```
**Purpose**: Safely increment generation count with upsert logic
**Performance**: Single atomic operation
**Usage**: Called after each TTS generation

### 4. `update_updated_at_column`
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER
```
**Purpose**: Automatically update `updated_at` timestamps
**Performance**: Minimal overhead, runs on UPDATE only
**Usage**: Applied via triggers on 6 tables

---

## 5. Automatic Triggers

### Updated_at Triggers (6 tables)
All tables with `updated_at` columns have automatic triggers:

1. `custom_voices` - `update_custom_voices_updated_at`
2. `stories` - `update_stories_updated_at`
3. `stripe_customers` - `update_stripe_customers_updated_at`
4. `stripe_orders` - `update_stripe_orders_updated_at`
5. `stripe_subscriptions` - `update_stripe_subscriptions_updated_at`
6. `user_generation_counts` - `update_user_generation_counts_updated_at`

**Benefit**: Ensures timestamps are always accurate without application code

---

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### RLS Policy Optimizations
All RLS policies use the subquery pattern for `auth.uid()`:
```sql
-- ❌ BAD (re-evaluated per row)
user_id = auth.uid()

-- ✅ GOOD (evaluated once per query)
user_id = (select auth.uid())
```

**Impact**: Dramatically improves query performance at scale

### Index Strategy
- All foreign keys have indexes for join performance
- User lookup columns indexed for RLS policy checks
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes on deleted_at to exclude soft-deleted records

### Query Patterns Optimized
1. **User's own data lookups** - Fast via user_id indexes
2. **Public story queries** - Fast via is_public index
3. **Recent activities** - Fast via composite user+created_at index
4. **Billing portal lookups** - Fast via new customer_id index
5. **Generation count queries** - Fast via composite user+month index

---

## 7. Security Improvements

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users can only access their own data
- Public stories are read-only for others
- Stripe data modifications only via service role (webhooks)
- All policies explicitly check authentication

### Service Role Policies
Stripe tables allow service role to manage data:
- Enables Stripe webhooks to update subscriptions
- Users can only view, not modify
- Maintains data integrity

### Deleted Records
All Stripe tables support soft deletes:
- `deleted_at` column for audit trail
- Indexes exclude deleted records
- Queries automatically filter out deleted data

---

## 10. Recommended Queries for Monitoring

### Check RLS Status
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Check Index Usage
```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname,
  idx_scan as times_used
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Check Table Bloat
```sql
SELECT
  relname,
  n_live_tup as live_rows,
  n_dead_tup as dead_rows,
  round(100.0 * n_dead_tup / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) as dead_ratio
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

### Check Missing Indexes on Foreign Keys
```sql
SELECT
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_indexes
    WHERE tablename = tc.table_name
    AND indexdef LIKE '%' || kcu.column_name || '%'
  ) as missing_index
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_schema = 'public';
```

- Optimized joins

---

## 12. Known Limitations

### Current Design Decisions
1. **Soft Deletes** - Records are marked deleted, not removed
   - Benefit: Audit trail and data recovery
   - Tradeoff: Slight storage overhead

2. **Service Role for Stripe** - Only service role can modify Stripe data
   - Benefit: Data integrity, prevents user tampering
   - Tradeoff: All updates must come via webhooks

3. **Public Stories** - Public flag allows read access to all authenticated users
   - Benefit: Content sharing capability
   - Tradeoff: Cannot restrict specific users

---

## 13. Future Optimization Opportunities

### When Database Grows
1. **Partitioning** - Consider partitioning `user_activities` by month when > 1M rows
2. **Materialized Views** - Add materialized views for analytics when needed
3. **Read Replicas** - Consider read replicas when read load increases
4. **Connection Pooling** - Already handled by Supabase, no action needed

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Set up alerts for:
   - Dead row ratio > 20%
   - Table size doubling
   - Slow query logs
   - Connection pool exhaustion

2. Regular maintenance:
   - Review unused indexes quarterly
   - Analyze query patterns monthly
   - Update statistics after bulk operations
   - Review RLS policy performance
